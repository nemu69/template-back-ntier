# Roslynator Code Formatting and Analysis

This project uses [Roslynator](mdc:https:/josefpihrt.github.io/docs/roslynator) for code analysis and formatting. Roslynator is a set of code analysis tools for C#, powered by Roslyn.

## Code Style Rules

Code style rules are defined in [.editorconfig](mdc:.editorconfig) and enforced during build. Common style requirements include:

- Trailing whitespace should be removed
- Explicit types are preferred over `var`
- Trailing commas should be added to multi-line initializers and parameter lists
- Pattern matching should be used for null checks
- Proper indentation and formatting for initializers, method chains, and argument lists

## Fixing Code Style Issues

When encountering linter errors, you can fix them using the Roslynator CLI:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g roslynator.dotnet.cli
roslynator fix <PROJECT|SOLUTION> --format
```

For specific issues with formatting, you can run:

```bash
roslynator fix <PROJECT|SOLUTION> --diagnostics RCS1037 RCS0053 RCS1260 RCS1248 RCS1008 RCS1264 RCS1250
```

## Common Diagnostics IDs

- `RCS1037`: Remove trailing white-space
- `RCS0053`: Fix formatting of an initializer
- `RCS1260`: Add trailing comma
- `RCS1248`: Use pattern matching to check for null
- `RCS1008`: Use explicit type instead of 'var'
- `RCS1264`: Use explicit type instead of 'var'
- `RCS1250`: Simplify object creation
- `RCS0054`: Fix formatting of a call chain

## Integration with the Project

When creating new code, make sure to follow the existing style patterns and run the code analyzer before committing changes. This helps maintain a consistent code style across the entire codebase.
