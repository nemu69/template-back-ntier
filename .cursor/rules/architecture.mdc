# Project Architecture

This project follows an n-tier architecture with the following structure:

## Core Project
The [Core](mdc:Core) project is the central component containing:
- Models/Entities in [Entities](mdc:Core/Entities)
- Database context in [Shared/Data](mdc:Core/Shared/Data)
- Repositories in [Shared/Repositories](mdc:Core/Shared/Repositories)
- Services in [Shared/Services](mdc:Core/Shared/Services)
- Unit of Work in [Shared/UnitOfWork](mdc:Core/Shared/UnitOfWork)

## API Projects
API projects start with the prefix "Api" (e.g., ApiMovie, ApiCity) and depend on the Core project.
Each API project provides endpoints for a specific domain area.

API controllers should follow the endpoints pattern defined in [Shared/Endpoints](mdc:Core/Shared/Endpoints).

## Adding New API Projects
When adding a new API project:
1. Name it with the "Api" prefix followed by the domain name (e.g., ApiCustomer)
2. Add a reference to the Core project
3. Create controllers that inject services from Core.Shared.Services
4. Follow the Endpoints pattern for consistent response handling

## Development Workflow
When creating a new feature:
1. Define the entity model in Core/Entities
2. Create or use existing repositories in Core/Shared/Repositories
3. Implement services in Core/Shared/Services
4. Create an API project for the domain if it doesn't exist
5. Create endpoints that inherit from BaseEndpoint or BaseEntityEndpoint
6. Inject the required services from Core
